# [Project 1: Bellabeat Fitness Tracker Trends Analysis](https://github.com/JaytaAnalysis/BellabeatProject/tree/main)

Bellabeat is a company that specializes in producing health-based
technology products for women. One of their products, the [Leaf](https://bellabeat.com/product/leaf-urban/), can be
attached to common accessories like bracelets, necklaces, or clips. The
Leaf communicates health data to the user’s Bellabeat app so that the
user can monitor their health data. This product bears a lot of
similarity to the Fitbit, a smart watch that records health information
about the users while they wear it. This project explores some Fitbit
user data in order to find trends that Bellabeat can take advantage of
to improve product growth and user satisfaction.

The dataset used in this project is called [“FitBit Fitness Tracker
Data”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit), posted to Kaggle by the user [MÖBIUS](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic). The data include calories burned, levels of intensity, steps taken, heartrate, weight, and their
recorded times of the day/hour/minute. I will use the data to explain
how Bellabeat can adjust their app/Leaf communication and notifactions
to improve current user experience and make their service more
attractive to the broader market.
